# RHCSA Projects

This repository contains a curated set of hands‑on projects and study notes to prepare for the **Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)** exam.  Each numbered directory maps to a major exam objective and contains a `README.md` explaining the concepts, along with one or more scripts or lab guides you can run to practise the topic.

## Modules overview

| 20    | Software management – RPM/DNF basics, AppStream module streams and creating local repositories. |
| 21    | Troubleshooting boot – breaking into the initramfs, systemd emergency/rescue targets, dracut and fstab repair. |

Each module’s README includes a **Useful Commands** section, example usage and practice exercises.  Scripts are intended to be run with superuser privileges in a test environment; **never run them on production machines**.

To get started, clone the repository, pick a module and follow the steps in its README.  Feel free to customise or extend the projects to fit your own learning style.
