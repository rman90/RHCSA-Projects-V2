# Log all debug messages from any facility to a separate file.
# Place this file in /etc/rsyslog.d/ and restart rsyslog.

*.*;debug     /var/log/messages-debug

# Explanation:
# The first selector matches all facilities at all priorities and discards nothing (the semicolon terminates the rule).
# The second selector matches all messages at the 'debug' priority (7) and writes them to /var/log/messages-debug.
# Combine this with other rules as needed in your environment.
